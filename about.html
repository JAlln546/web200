  <p>My name is Aimee Serene. My Mother gave me that first and middle name, and throughout my life as a free spirited wildchild we always giggled about how the last thing anyone would call me was “Serene”. </p>

  <p>I was loud, both in my physical presence and vocal display (and still am today, go figure!). What has changed though is my ability to remain grounded. I found this through dance, sound and vibrational healing modalities. </p>

  <p>The greatest lesson I have learned, is that every step I’ve taken in my life has brought me here to where I am today. Granted me the opportunity to learn more, expand my horizons and bring my gift into the world to share.</p>

  <p>I wouldn’t be here without having been there, so allow to tell you where I’ve been and what I’ve been learning along the way! Throughout the past 20 years, I have studied and practiced in the following areas (these leave out the decades of “work” I’ve done in the areas that do not directly apply to this area of study):</p>
  <div id="list">
    <ul>
  <li>Massage Therapy, Nutrition and Healing with Whole Foods (Heartwood Institute 2007)</li>
  <li>Yoga (personal practice for 16 years)</li>
<li>  Pilates (Instructor 2000)</li>
<li>  Dancer (18 years) & Dance Instructor (ages 4-11)</li>
<li>  Sound Healer (beginning in 2017 - infinity) </li></ul></div>

  <p style="clear:both;">My goal is to touch 100,000 hearts and minds with the this work. While payment for treatments is appreciated, the biggest reason I am doing this is to focus on dedicating my time to those members of our community who many not otherwise have an opportunity to experience such a decadent and relaxing form of healing and meditation. </p>

  <p>I find it best to get to know one another with stories of our experiences in life that brought us to where we are today. Though it is long, I welcome you to learn as much as you would like to about me below in my story of healing and discovery. </p>

  <p>If I say anything that rings true for you please feel free to contact me, we are all on our life’s journey, and I would love to hear about yours too! </p>
