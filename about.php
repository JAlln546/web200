      <h1>Hello! I'm Aimee!</h1>
      <img src="images/aimee2.jpg" alt="Aimee Being Aimee!">
      <p>My name is Aimee Serene. My Mother gave me that first and middle name, and throughout my life as a free spirited wildchild we always giggled about how the last thing anyone would call me was “Serene”.</p>

<p>I was loud, both in my physical presence and vocal display (and still am today, go figure!). What has changed though is my ability to remain grounded. I found this through Sound and Vibrational Healing modalities. </p>

<p>The greatest lesson I have learned, is that every step I’ve taken in my life has brought me here to where I am today. Granted me the opportunity to learn more, expand my horizons and bring my gift into the world to share.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be here without having been there, so allow to tell you where I’ve been and what I’ve been learning along the way! Throughout the past 20 years, I have studied and practiced in the following areas (these leave out the decades of “work” I’ve done in the areas that do not directly apply to this area of study):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Massage Therapy, Nutrition and Healing with Whole Foods (Heartwood Institute 2007)</li>
<li>Yoga (personal practice for 16 years)</li>
<li>Pilates (Instructor 2000)</li>
<li>Sound Healer (beginning in 2017 - infinity)</li></ul></p>

<p>My goal is to touch 100,000 hearts and minds with the this work. While payment for treatments is appreciated, the biggest reason I am doing this is to focus on dedicating my time to those members of our community who many not otherwise have an opportunity to experience such a decadent and relaxing form of healing and meditation. </p>

<p>I find it best to get to know one another with stories of our experiences in life that brought us to where we are today. Though it is long, I welcome you to learn as much as you would like to about me below in my story of healing and discovery. </p>

<p>If I say anything that rings true for you please feel free to contact me, we are all on our life’s journey, and I would love to hear about yours too! </p>

<p><em>Let me share my journey with you...</em></p>

<p>I would have never thought I would end up doing work in Sound Healing, even though unbeknownst to me, my entire life has been healing through sound all along. </p>

<p>I started out as a dancer, rhythm and movement were as natural as the air I breathed and there were few steps taken in my life that weren’t to music. My path with movement has allowed me to explore many modalities including: Jazz, Salsa, Ballet, Hip-Hop, Popping, Breakdancing, Gymnastics, Surfing, Skiing, Snowboarding, Pilates, Yoga, Biking, Hiking, Rock Climbing, Cliff Diving and a willingness to always try anything new that presented itself. In fact it has been nearly impossibly for me to stay put for more than just a few minutes as I always have so much energy that begs to be release through some form of movement! </p>

<p>When I think about things in the context of energy in and energy out, it looks like this:</p>

<p><em>As a dancer…</em></p>

<p><ul><li>Sound emanates from speakers or instruments and the vibrations find there way into my body</li>
<li>My body takes in the vibration, then create a movement mechanism to allow the music to travel out through my limbs</li>
<li>There was a constant flow of energy moving in and out with intention and purpose</li>
<li>The energy never stayed IN my body for long, always moving immediately through and playing my body as though IT were the instrument</li></ul></p>

<p>The idea of sitting still and not moving to the music never crossed my mind, movement has always been my meditation. I get lost in the flow state of dancing, breathing with each move,  finding synchrony and harmony as my body and the music meet is such a sweet rhythm.</p>

<p>But passion for these movements was lost somewhere along the way. I stopped listening to music for about 7 years unintentionally ~ I just woke up one day and realized how long it had been missing from my life. I went through the motions of exercise, fed myself as comfort and didn’t even recognize my own body or personality anymore. </p>

<p>LIFE was happening without me as an active and passionate participant! </p>

<p><em>The wake up call…</em></p>

<p>Meditation came full circle back into my life.</p>

<p>For many years I had pursued a strong interest in Eastern traditions, medicine, and holistic practices only to lose my way as I dedicated my life to my job and inability to hold my own boundaries for nearly a decade. Sacrificing my health, both mentally and physically as I pushed forward on the path to checking the boxes in my measure of success ~ I found myself burnt out, stressed out, and always believing if I could just hold out a little longer...I would be there...and THEN I could have my freedom, health and happiness back. </p>

<p>It took a few earth shattering wake up calls to allow me to hear that part of myself calling me back to the sound of healing (though I had no idea at the time that I would end up writing this to you today!). </p>

<p>It started with a constant connection to my meditation practice. I knew in order to step OUT, I had to step IN. I was so OUT of touch with myself that I had no idea where to begin; thus I started listening to guided meditations, affirmation meditations, exploring the Solfeggio frequencies, and creating a space (both in my heart and in my house) to meditate and simply BE. </p>

<p>For about 8 months, there was hardly a moment of my day outside of work where I wasn’t in some form of meditative state:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I woke up and put on headphones, listening to guided meditations or affirmations until I walked into my office at work</li>
<li>As soon as I left work, the headphones went back in</li>
<li>I listened to music tuned to various targeted Solfeggio frequencies, explored how to find tranquility in the sounds of water, chanting, and drumming while I made dinner, showered, and prepared for bed</li>
<li>I found 8-9 hour sleep meditations and self hypnosis that I listened to as I fell asleep and allowed my mind to explore</li></ul> </p>

<p><em>Following the musical notes…</em></p>

<p>This might come as a huge shock…</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sense of peace I had never known before. I felt like I was walking through *this* world, but was not truly here. My mind was at ease and the possibilities that lay before me were now infinite. </p>

<p>I began a journal during this period of time, capturing the ideas, or techniques that I was using to bring my head back INTO the clouds! How funny that for years we are told to get our heads OUT of the clouds...when that is in fact the very best place for our heads to be. ALWAYS dreaming but ever present. </p>


<p><em>Easy Effort...</em></p>

<p>And suddenly, the things that I wanted to bring into my life started showing up; I became crystal clear with my intentions, my goals, and my expectations. Things that I didn’t even know I wanted in my life began presenting themselves in the most beautiful and inspiring ways. </p>

<p>I found my way into my first Sound Bath, then a Float Tank, Neurofeedback, and suddenly…
<strong>I realized I was being STILL.</strong></p>

<p>All of the music and vibration was entering my body...and resonating, staying as long as it needed to before exiting in whatever fashion it decided on. The change here was that the release of the energy was not immediate. Something was happening in my body, my mind, and my heart from all of these “sounds” that I was absorbing in new ways. </p>

<p>I knew I had to explore further. And the SOUNDS knew they had me hooked. </p>

<p>While I was musically inclined as a child, playing piano, orga, violin, flute, guitar and drums at various points in my life, I have not touched an instrument in well over a decade. The idea of BEING the musician didn’t even cross my mind until I heard a few different instruments that I couldn’t get out of my mind…</p>

<p>I would listen to singing bowl CD’s, attend as many sound baths as I could find locally, and finally, I decided it was time to step into the space of a musician once more.</p>

<p>But it is so much more than just music…</p>

<p><em>Finding the Healer within…</em></p>

<p>The truth is, I was finding my inner healer. Connecting to a part of me long since forgotten, and the SOUND...the VIBRATION...was stirring something up inside of me that was like a sleeping giant waiting for an earthquake to rouse her from slumber. </p>

<p>Well the earthquake of sound SHOOK me AWAKE, and I allowed whatever was awaiting me to lead me down the path.</p>

<p>Having blind faith is one thing...having blind faith in yourSELF is a whole nother journey.
