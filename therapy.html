    <h4>  Finding solitude in sound </h4>

<p>We have all experienced a moment where a sound brings us to silence. A song or a voice that suddenly soothes the mind and body in an unexplainable way. </p>

<p>We have music we turn to for various emotional and mental purposes; whether those be for relaxation, sadness, joy, excitement, reflection, creativity...the list is neverending. But we can all say that music (SOUND) has been a source of comfort, safety, a source of memory, a way to connect, or a saviour in times of solitude and isolation. The question we don’t ask, is WHY? What about these sounds resonates with us and derives the emotional association we connect? </p>

<h4>Vibration…</h4>

<p>There are different tones and frequencies which resonate in the body and correlate to different emotional or physical aspects in ways that can either agitated, or relieve our senses. We subconsciously seek these out at times and try to match or contradict our INTERNAL vibration, with an EXTERNAL vibration to create a relief or an increase in sensation.</p>

<p>When the body and mind are still, the introduction of a particular series of sounds (vibrations) can have a profoundly powerful effect on our physical and mental states.</p>

<p>These effects will vary person to person and may be any/all of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deeply relaxing for the body</li>
<li>Relieve stress</li>
<li>Alleviate physical pain </li>
<li>Assist in meditation</li>
<li>Lower blood pressure</li>
<li>Increased sleep quality</li>
<li>Reduced Anxiety</li>
<li>And so many more…</li>
</ul>
